{"contents": "<h1>About Pianistica</h1>\n\n<p>Pianistica is a fork of Sight Reading Trainer.</p>\n\n<p>Original Sight Reading Trainer site is <a href=\"https://sightreading.training/\">https://sightreading.training/</a></p>\n\n<p>Fork source code on GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/maizy/sightreading.training\">https://github.com/maizy/sightreading.training</a></p>\n\n<p>Pianistica should work on modern desktop browsers. For iOS/iPadOS use free \n<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/web-midi-browser/id953846217\">Web MIDI Browser</a>\nwhich is fully compatable with the fork.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1>About Sightreading.training</h1>\n\n<p>This site is a free way to practice <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight-reading\">sight\nreading</a> by playing randomly\ngenerated sheet music or by playing along with pre-programmed songs.\nAdditionally, you'll find some other tools to help you with your ear and music\ntheory in general.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This project is 100% free &amp; open-source</strong>, you can contribute to development\non GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/leafo/sightreading.training\">https://github.com/leafo/sightreading.training</a></p>\n\n<h2>A Work In Progress</h2>\n\n<p>This app is far from complete and is still being developed. If you have ideas\nor feedback please <a href=\"https://github.com/leafo/sightreading.training/issues\">post on our\ntracker</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Sounds</h2>\n\n<p>This app has a built in piano &amp; metronome instrument. Alternatively, you can\nconfigure a MIDI output device so you can have any synthesizer generate sound\nfor you. Configure sound by clicking the <strong>MIDI</strong> button on the top right of\nthe page.</p>\n\n<p>If you're using <em>Play Along</em> mode with MIDI output, a metronome is played on\nchannel 10. It should be a GM Drum Kit to sound correctly.</p>\n\n<h2>The Tools</h2>\n\n<p>There are many different tools included to practice your music and sight reading skills:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Staff</strong> -- Notes are randomly generated for you to sight read and play. This will ensure that you're always reading and never playing from memory. In the simplest mode you'll play one note at a time, but you can increase complexity by clicking <strong>configure</strong>, and changing how notes are generated. In order to play more than 1 note at a time you need a MIDI controller connected!</li>\n<li><strong>Play Along</strong> -- Pre-programmed songs are available for you to play. You can control the playback speed, and configure a metronome by using the MIDI output option.</li>\n<li><strong>Ear Training</strong> -- Various tools to practice your ear, including interval recognition and playing back a melody.</li>\n<li><strong>Flash Cards</strong> -- Generates random flash cards to help you memorize or quickly identify things related to music theory</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Using a MIDI Keyboard</h2>\n\n<p>Although it's possible to play using your mouse or computer keyboard, we\nrecommend connecting your digital piano or MIDI keyboard to your computer so\nyou can play directly into the software. A MIDI keyboard is required to enter\nmultiple notes at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>MIDI support is only available in Chrome at this time. If you have a USB OTG\ncable you can even connect your keyboard to your Android phone or tablet.</p>\n\n<h1>Tips for successful sight reading</h1>\n\n<h2>Practice daily</h2>\n\n<p>Sight reading takes a very long time to learn. Practice frequently to make\nreading notes second nature. You goal should be able to see notes and instantly\nknow where to move your hands. As you get faster at reading, add more\nsimultaneous notes.</p>\n\n<h2>Use real music</h2>\n\n<p>This app is not enough to learn how to sight read. Practice reading real sheet\nmusic in addition to using this app. Read things that you have the skill to\nplay. Sight reading isn't just about recognizing the notes, but also playing\nwhat's written. If you don't have the coordination to play something yet then\nmemorize that piece and find something else to sight read.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Author's tip:</strong> Try your local thrift store to find music. You can generally\n  find plenty of music you've never seen before of all different skill levels</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Practice without looking at your hands</h2>\n\n<p>Looking at your hands means less time reading sheet music.  Practice playing\nnotes without looking down. This isn't about memorizing the location of every\nnote on the keyboard, but rather understanding how your hands will move to go\nto the next notes from the notes you just played.</p>\n\n<h2>Practice chunking and reading ahead</h2>\n\n<p>Chunking means reading a block of notes at once then playing it out of your\nmemory. Reading ahead gives you time to figure out how to move your hands as\nyou're playing.</p>\n"}

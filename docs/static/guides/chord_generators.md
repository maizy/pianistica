# Chord Mode

In addition to sight reading notes on sheet music, you can use the chord staff to sight read chords by name. Chords are generated in the desired key, and you'll need to press the minimum number of notes to continue to the next chord.

You can access chord mode by going to **Staff**, selecting **Configure**, then **Chord** under the *Staff* option. If you want to generate chords outside a specific key you can choose **Chromatic** mode under *Key*.

Here are the other configurable options:

* **notes** -- The number of notes in each chord, letting you choose between triads or seven chords.
* **common notes** -- The number of notes the next chord should share with the previous chord. This can make the chords sound more connected

## Playing a chord

To successfully play a chord you need to play at least all the notes that are in the chord. You can play the chords in any voicing you want, repeating any number of notes. The order the notes are played in doesn't matter. You can use this to create additional challenges for yourself:

* Play in a specific inversion -- Get comfortable playing all the chords in a specific inversion
* Minimize movement -- Try to minimize the amount you have to move your hand by choosing an inversion to play that is closest to the chord you just played
* Play with both hands -- Learn the chords with both of your hands. You can try using the same voicing, or a different voicing for each hand

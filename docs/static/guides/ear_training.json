{"contents": "<h1>Ear Training</h1>\n\n<p>This app comes with a few ear training tools:</p>\n\n<h2>Interval Recognition with Melodies</h2>\n\n<p>A common strategy for memorizing intervals is to associate their sound with\nmelodies from popular songs that you've recognized. Common melodies are\nincluded for all 12 intervals both ascending and descending.</p>\n\n<p>By clicking <em>Next melody</em> you can randomly pull up a melody. You can either\nplay the root or the entire melody. Try clicking <em>Play root</em>, then trying to\nsing the rest to help you memorize the melodies.</p>\n\n<h3>Autoplay Mode</h3>\n\n<p>Autoplay mode will continuously play random intervals, followed by a short\npause, followed by the melody. You can use this to hear an interval, attempt to\nguess it, then confirm based on the melody that plays afterwards. It's a good\nway to practice without having to use your hands.</p>\n\n<p>Autoplay mode has a few additional options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Randomize root</strong> -- Randomly transpose the melody each time a new one is selected</li>\n<li><strong>Order</strong> -- You can choose to play the interval melodically or harmonically (both notes at same time). You can also use reverse to play the interval melodically, but in reverse order, or an additional challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Melody Playback</h2>\n\n<p>The computer will generate a short melody. After you hear it, you should play\nit back with either your connected MIDI keyboard or the on-screen keyboard.\nCorrectly play the melody and to automatically get the next melody.</p>\n\n<p>The timing of the notes is not considered, only the pitches you play are\nchecked. You can skip the melody by clicking <em>Next Melody</em> or hear it again by\nclicking <em>Repeat melody</em>. You can trigger the melody to repeat also by using\nany of the sliders, knobs, or pedals on your MIDI controller.</p>\n\n<p>The following options are available:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Notes per melody</strong> -- The number of notes in the generated melody</li>\n<li><strong>Continuous melody</strong> -- The next generated melody is continued from the previously generated melody. This will cause the interval between the end of the previous and the start of the next to generally be pretty small</li>\n<li><strong>Notes per column</strong> -- How many notes to play at once</li>\n<li><strong>Direction</strong> -- Which direction intervals in the melody can go</li>\n<li><strong>Scale</strong> -- Constrain the potential notes to a specific scale</li>\n</ul>\n"}

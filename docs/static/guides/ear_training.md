# Ear Training

This app comes with a few ear training tools:

## Interval Recognition with Melodies

A common strategy for memorizing intervals is to associate their sound with
melodies from popular songs that you've recognized. Common melodies are
included for all 12 intervals both ascending and descending.

By clicking *Next melody* you can randomly pull up a melody. You can either
play the root or the entire melody. Try clicking *Play root*, then trying to
sing the rest to help you memorize the melodies.

### Autoplay Mode

Autoplay mode will continuously play random intervals, followed by a short
pause, followed by the melody. You can use this to hear an interval, attempt to
guess it, then confirm based on the melody that plays afterwards. It's a good
way to practice without having to use your hands.

Autoplay mode has a few additional options:

* **Randomize root** -- Randomly transpose the melody each time a new one is selected
* **Order** -- You can choose to play the interval melodically or harmonically (both notes at same time). You can also use reverse to play the interval melodically, but in reverse order, or an additional challenge.

## Melody Playback

The computer will generate a short melody. After you hear it, you should play
it back with either your connected MIDI keyboard or the on-screen keyboard.
Correctly play the melody and to automatically get the next melody.

The timing of the notes is not considered, only the pitches you play are
checked. You can skip the melody by clicking *Next Melody* or hear it again by
clicking *Repeat melody*. You can trigger the melody to repeat also by using
any of the sliders, knobs, or pedals on your MIDI controller.

The following options are available:

* **Notes per melody** -- The number of notes in the generated melody
* **Continuous melody** -- The next generated melody is continued from the previously generated melody. This will cause the interval between the end of the previous and the start of the next to generally be pretty small
* **Notes per column** -- How many notes to play at once
* **Direction** -- Which direction intervals in the melody can go
* **Scale** -- Constrain the potential notes to a specific scale
